    description: "If you've got a concept yet are unfamiliar with the requirements and scope of work, we can help you. We help bring it to life through detailed research, locating your target audience, and business environment. Once this is done, we undergo extensive competitor analysis, configure the initial scope and technical requirements and then create a hypothesis. \n \n After getting a hypothesis, we create a prototype. This allows us to test the hypothesis, define the scope and then feel your idea. Based on the scope of your project, if we can freeze the requirements, we will deploy waterfall development. Similarly, if the scope is clear, but you want to make further improvements and changes, then we use an Agile model."
